# My Captsone Project:  Weather forecast service  

For a given State, City, ZipCode displays up to the minute weather data.

Weather data is displayed in a table format and on a map.

# Technologies Used:

Thanks to Team TreeHouse, https://teamtreehouse.com, a great place for anyone to get started in Software Development.

This project uses Node.js, https://nodejs.org/ and Express.Js,"https://expressjs.com/" for https server and routing.

I use Mongoose, https://mongoosejs.com/", for db backend.

React.Js, https://reactjs.org/ and Babel.js, https://babeljs.io/, for front-end UI/UX.

# This project integrates data from several API sources:  

[MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) - for geocoding and mapping services

[Forcast.io](https://darksky.net/dev/docs) - for weather forecast data

[timezonedb](https://timezonedb.com/api) - for timezone data

# Standards:

And it's all javascript es2015, web-app best-practices, TSL2 security and html5 web-standards compliant!

# TD-Project12 : My Captsone Project for Team TreeHouse FSJS Tech Degree

# Purpose of this branch...(for posterity =)

  - this basically the same as the SSR-0.0.1 branch
  - but preserves the 2 routes as separate express servers
    - /weather:location,
      - basic OPEN REST API,
        - no auth, no users login, no session store, no pretty display for data queried
    - /, root route for the SSR REACT APP
      - full REACT SSR App

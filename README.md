# PROJECT UPDATE:
- Well after much consternation it looks like I will be dropping REACT .. :white_frowning_face:
  - and implementing the views of my Weather App using PUG….
  - on the bright-side I will finally be deploying my app and submitting .. :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: …  
  - so on my express server
    - the home page will be rendered with a simple app header and input form
    - ….after….location input is submitted
    - …the server receive the location input via get /:location route,  I think
    - the server will make the api calls, response will be stored, indexing of data using PostgreSQL db,
    - model validation and and data model methods will process the data
    - then data points will be dropped into HTML using PUG templates
    - the home view will re-rendered again, with a sub-view containing a location-Bar, for the weather forecast summary
    - I will not have a backend server…
    - just a front-end server with 2 routes:
      - 1 for home, which have the input search form as a sub-view
        - and also will also render the weather-summaries sub-view for each location…
        - and then the full weather-details view that is rendered when a location-weather-summary is clicked-on…
    - well that's it :sweat_smile:  
    - of course many details to work out… but I now see light at the end of my tunnel…. :joy:

# FINAL PUSH:

Daniel Perez, Captsone - Team TreeHouse FSJS Project, "The Chef's Kitchen"

Status: the web app is not online, yet, still in development

# My Captsone Project, "The Chef's Kitchen":

Inspired by my wife, who is a great chef, it is excellent way to showcase all the latest software technologies made possible by our ever connected world!

With this app, a chef will be able to get recipes, source local ingredients, find cookware and cooking utensils and even watch videos of the recipes being made.

Also, a chef will be able use a "create your own kitchen" feature, save all the favorites and come back to them later.

# Technologies Used:

Thanks to Team TreeHouse, https://teamtreehouse.com, a great place for anyone to get started in Software Development.

This project uses Node.js, https://nodejs.org/ and Express.Js,"https://expressjs.com/" for https server and routing.

I use Mongoose, https://mongoosejs.com/", for db backend.

React.Js, https://reactjs.org/ and Babel.js, https://babeljs.io/, for front-end UI/UX.

# This project integrates data from several API sources:  

[MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) - for mapping services

[Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers) - for mapping and sourcing local vendors, produce, farms and grocers

[Wikipedia](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Web_APIs_hub) for info about and how-tos for items searched

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/yt/dev/) - for the videos

[Spoonalar](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) - for the recipes and ingredients

[Pinterest](https://developers.pinterest.com/) - for saving items of interest

# Standards:

And it's all javascript es2015, web-app best-practices, TSL2 security and html5 web-standards compliant!

# More to come: ...

Will eventually be an in-depth look at the making of "The Chef's Kitchen"

Daniel Perez, Captsone - Team TreeHouse FSJS Project, "The Chef's Kitchen"

Status: the web app is not online, yet, still in development

# My Captsone Project, "The Chief's Kitchen":

Inspired by my wife, who is a great chef, it is excellent way to showcase all the latest software technologies made possible by our ever connected world!

With this app, a chef will be able to get recipes, source local ingredients, find cookware and cooking utensils and even watch videos of the recipes being made.

Also, a chef will be able use a "create your own kitchen", save all the favorites and come back to them later.

# Technologies Used:

Thanks to Team TreeHouse, https://teamtreehouse.com, a great place for anyone to get started in Software Development.

This project uses Node.js, https://nodejs.org/ and Express.Js,"https://expressjs.com/" for https server and routing.

I use Mongoose, https://mongoosejs.com/", for db backend.

React.Js, href="https://reactjs.org/"> and Babel.js, href="https://babeljs.io/">, for front-end UI/UX.

MapBox, https://www.mapbox.com/
Yelp, https://www.yelp.com/developers?country=US

# Standards:

And it's all javascript es2015, web-app best-practices, TSL2 security and html5 web-standards compliant!

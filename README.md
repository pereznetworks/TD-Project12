# WeatherX : A Universal Multi-platform App

## Status:

- Starting fresh

  - I am making a clean break from my previous work on this project for at least 2 reasons:

    - Problems with key dependencies.

      - some of these NPM Packages had unresolved vulnerabilities or are no longer maintained

    - A lot has changed in the last 2 years

- The original project code and documentation, will be moved to a private repo.


### Project Summary

#### The App

  - A simple app that displays the current and forecasted weather conditions for a specific location.

#### Multiplatform and Universal

  - The entire app will be built with both front-end and server-side re-usable components.

  - The server-side components will be built to at least be easily adapted or ported for any production environment.

  - First, a web app version will be built.

  - Then a front-end native app will be built for Google Android, Apple macOS and iOS, and Microsoft Windows 10.

#### Open Source

  - The code for the app, will be maintained here on this public repo, to the extent possible.  Some key components and key data will have to be kept private, to ensure the security of the release versions of the app.

#### Front-end

  - The Front-end components will be built using React, and React Native

#### Server-side

  - Server-side will be built using Node.js, NPM, Express and React

#### Database

  - Server-side database will be PostgreSQL
